# Movie-Recommendation-System
A Content-Based Movie Recommendation System is an intelligent algorithm designed to suggest movies to users based on the characteristics of the films they have previously liked or interacted with. This system operates by analyzing the attributes of the movies, such as genre, director, actors, plot summary, and other metadata, to build a profile of each movie.When a user expresses interest in certain films (through ratings, views, or likes), the recommendation system creates a user profile by extracting features from the movies they prefer. It then compares these features with other films in the database to recommend new movies that closely match the user's preferences.
